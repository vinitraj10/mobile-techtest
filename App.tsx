                The screen must have the title "Magazine issues". We would like you to display the data contained in
                data.json. Between the title and the data, you should create 4 toggles which filter based on cover name.
                The default is that all 4 are switched on. Switching off a toggle should hide all instances of that
                issue type. Switching it back on should bring them back. We would like you to include a footnote at the
                bottom "The full archive is available to Which? members". The whole screen should be scrollable, not
                just the data.

                You should consider mobile portrait, mobile landscape and tablet devices. Mobile portrait will have one
                item per row. Mobile landscape will have 2 items per row. Tablet will have 3 items per row with the
                content centered. The content should not touch the edge of the screen. You should take care to account
                for phone notches.
