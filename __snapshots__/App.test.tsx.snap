exports[`<App /> should be able to render the tech test description 1`] = `"The screen must have the title \\"Magazine issues\\". We would like you to display the data contained in data.json. Between the title and the data, you should create 4 toggles which filter based on cover name. The default is that all 4 are switched on. Switching off a toggle should hide all instances of that issue type. Switching it back on should bring them back. We would like you to include a footnote at the bottom \\"The full archive is available to Which? members\\". The whole screen should be scrollable, not just the data."`;
